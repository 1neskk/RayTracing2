Continuation of my previous [Ray Tracing](https://github.com/1neskk/raytracing) project

## Requirements
- [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/)
- ImGui and GLFW binaries are not included in this repository.

### Get Started
Officially supports Windows 10/11 and Visual Studio 2022.

1. Clone recursively: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/1neskk/RayTracingAssignment`
2. Run `scripts/Setup.bat`
3. Open `RayTracing.sln` and hit F5 (preferably change configuration to Release first, Debug is slower)
